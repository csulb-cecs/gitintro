# gitintro: an introduction to Git

## Install
Check whether you have Git installed. If you need it, then, [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.

## Signup for GitHub
[GitHub](http://github.com) is a host of Git repositories, both public and private. There are other hosts of Git repositories, including [BitBucket by Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket).

## Download GitHub Desktop App
There are many Git clients to use with your Git repository. GitHub provides a GUI client, which is what is used in this workshop. [Download the GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com) to follow along with the workshop.

## Workshop Outline
1. Create repository on the [GitHub](http://github.com) website. Relevant commands: **git init**
2. Clone the repository on your computer. Relevant commands: **git clone**
3. Add new files or edit existing files on the repo... relevant commands: **git add** and **git status**
4. Commit files in staging area to repository... relevant commands **git commit** and **git log**
5. View differences
6. Resolving conflicts
7. Ignoring files (E.g.: never commit compiled code to repository)... See [ignoring files on GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)
8. Use branches

## Git Best Practice
1. Use small commits. If you are fixing two different bugs, use two different commits. Small commits are easier for everyone in the development team to understand.
2. Commit often.
3. Do not commit broken work. Test code before commit.
4. Write meaningful commit messages
5. Use branches.
6. Use Pull requests to alert other developers you've completed some work and you want them to review it. See [GitHub Help on Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
